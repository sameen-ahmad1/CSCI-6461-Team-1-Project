## Part 0 Instructions
To unpack the jar file run the command “jar xf part0.jar”. <br>

To run the assembler, you must call the test case in test0.java. This can be done on the
jar using the command “java -cp part0.jar test0”. This can also be done on the unpacked
files using the command “java test0”. <br>

A test case for the assembler is provided in /testFiles/test0_1 where test.asm is the
input and expectedListing.txt is the copy of the expected listing file for the test case <br>
